## Utilities

### Steem Utils

If you are building multiple Steem dapps, you will find the [Steem Utils](https://utils-js.steemsdk.com) library very help in reducing the amount of boiler code you have to write.

**Steem Utils** was born at [Steem Studios](https://steemstudios.com) as a way to reduce the number of times we had to write the same boilerplate for a new Steem app. We use it, and you can too!

It is an open source and well documented library, documentation is available at available: [Steem Utils](https://utils-js.steemsdk.com).
